Driven Video Summarization with Transformer Model." This intends to achieve a highly advanced video summarizing system to create a meaningful narrative based on visual content, as it is believed that this will build an efficiently automated tool designed to analyse, summarize,and  retrieve video informati -tion effectively.

Welcome to VIDEO-SUMMARIZATION-WITH-TRANSFORMER-MODELS!

In this repository, we introduce --The "Driven Video Summarization with Transformer Model" project focuses on developing a sophisticated system to summarize video content effectively using BLIP-2 for precise visual scene descriptions. It converts videos into frames, finds keyframes through sampling techniques, and generates contextually aligned summaries. Fine-tuning BLIP-2 ensures coherent and accurate content representation, supports standard formats (MP4, AVI, MOV), and leverages GPU acceleration for efficiency.
A more personalized summarization model, trained on SAMSUM, further refines the output of BLIP-2 by processing frame-level descriptions and then consolidating these into comprehensive summaries that make the text more understandable. The technique can help improve the quality of video content analysis while working less for industries in media, overcoming traditional summarizing techniques that often miss important details.
